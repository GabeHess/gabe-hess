<p>Hello, I'm Gabe Hess. I live in the mountains of Central Virginia, where I practice the Chinese martial art of kung fu, read voraciously, and write tactlessly. I also enjoy contemplating the many wonders of life and the endless stupidity of intelligent life. I believe truth to be absolute and worth pursuing, and it was with an eye towards spreading these beliefs that I started <a href="https://assortedscraps.com"><em>Assorted Scraps Of Wisdom And Folly</em></a> in the August of 2018 and <a href="https://www.pursuitoft.com" target="_blank"><em>In Pursuit Of Truth</em></a> in November of the same year.
