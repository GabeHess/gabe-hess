<p>Gabriel Hess, an outspoken contrarian earnestly seeking his ilk, lives in the mountains of Central Virginia, where he practices the ancient art of kung fu, reads, and writes with no surplus of tact. In stark defiance of modern thought, he believes truth to be absolute and worth pursuing. His essays may be mocked, read, or haughtily overlooked at <a href="https://assortedscraps.com" target="_blank"><em>Assorted Scraps of Wisdom and Folly</em></a> and <a href="https://www.pursuitoft.com" target="_blank"><em>In Pursuit of Truth</em></a>; his poems, at <a href="https://baublesandfrippery.com" target="_blank">Baubles and Frippery</a>.</p>
